# Shopping-App-Rest-API
A RESTful web app using Spring Boot for inventory, coupons, orders, and payments management. Integrates with a database for seamless operation.
To run the Spring Boot REST project, follow these steps:

Step 1:- Clone the Project: If you haven't already, clone the project repository to your local machine using Git. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:-
git clone <repository-url>

Step 2:-Open Project in IDE: Navigate to the project directory and open it in your preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Popular choices include IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or Spring Tool Suite.

Step 3:-Configure Database: Ensure that you have a compatible database installed on your machine (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, H2). Update the application.properties file with the necessary database connection details such as URL, username, and password.

Step 4:-Build the Project: Build the project using Maven or Gradle. If you're using Maven, run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:-mvn clean install.

Step 5:-Run the Application: Start the Spring Boot application. If you're using an IDE, you can run it directly from there. Alternatively, you can use Maven or Gradle to run the application:- mvn spring-boot:run.

Step 6:-Access Endpoints: Once the application is running, you can access the defined endpoints using a web browser, command-line tools like cURL, or tools like Postman. For example, if the application is running on localhost port 8080, you can access the endpoints using URLs like http://localhost:8080/inventory or http://localhost:8080/fetchCoupons.

Step 7:-Test Endpoints: Send HTTP requests to the endpoints defined in the project to test their functionality. Ensure that you provide appropriate request parameters and verify the responses to confirm that the application is working as expected.

By following these steps, you should be able to run the Spring Boot REST project on your local machine and interact with its endpoints.
